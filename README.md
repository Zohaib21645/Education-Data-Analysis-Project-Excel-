# üìä Education Data Analysis Project (Excel)

## üéØ Objectives
- To analyze student and school-level educational data.  
- To identify performance trends, enrollment patterns, and key academic indicators.  
- To create interactive Excel dashboards for better decision-making in the education sector.  

## ‚ùì Key Questions / KPIs
1. What is the distribution of students across different universities? 
2. How many students are enrolled in each program and academic level? 
3. What is the average GPA of students across different universities? 
4. How does the average GPA distribution vary by city? 
5. What is the percentage of students who have graduated versus those who have dropped 
out? 
6. How is the age distribution of students across different programs? 
7. What is the correlation between scholarship awards and funding types? 
8. How many students are staying in hostels versus those who are not? 
9. What is the distribution of students participating in extracurricular activities across 
different universities? 
10. How does the participation in extracurricular activities affect the average GPA of 
students? 
11. What is the distribution of students by academic discipline? 
12. How many students are receiving scholarships in each academic level? 
13. What is the percentage of students with government, semi-government, and private 
funding? 
14. How does the academic status (graduated or dropped) vary by year of enrollment? 
15. What is the relationship between city and the type of funding students receive? 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process
- Collected and cleaned educational dataset in Excel.  
- Used Pivot Tables and Charts to analyze scores, enrollment, and demographics.  
- Designed dashboards to visualize KPIs such as student distribution, performance, and trends.  

## üîé Insights
- Some schools outperform others consistently across subjects.  
- Certain subjects (like Math/Science) show higher variability in student performance.  
- Gender-based analysis reveals gaps in performance and enrollment in specific regions.  
- Regional trends indicate areas with high enrollment but lower average performance.  

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Excel can provide powerful insights into education data.  
The analysis supports data-driven decisions for improving teaching strategies, resource allocation, and student outcomes.
